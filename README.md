# maryttsant
A version of [maryTTS](https://github.com/marytts/marytts) using ant rather than maven, and producing a library without including external libraries.

To get the version of the original maryTTS library, you need to get it through maven, for the [maryTTS runtime](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.dfki.mary/marytts-runtime/5.2.1) and the
[maryTTS client](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/marytts/marytts-client) repositories.

The project is available at [github.com/hervegirod/maryttsant](https://github.com/hervegirod/maryttsant)

# Why this project?
**I don't own this code as it was originally posted by maryTTS**. However I felt the need to propose this github project with it because the maven build system can pose problems for users in some cases.
